# Notification System Implementation

## Overview

The notification system provides real-time alerts to users based on task-related events in the Blurr HR Portal. It enables admins to be notified of task updates by employees, and employees to be notified when tasks are assigned to them. This document outlines the implementation approach and technical details.

## Database Schema

- Added `Notification` model to Prisma schema with fields:

  - `id`: CUID primary key
  - `recipientId`: Foreign key to User
  - `title`: Notification title
  - `message`: Detailed notification message
  - `type`: Enum of notification types
  - `link`: URL to navigate to when clicked
  - `isRead`: Boolean flag for read status
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp

- Added `NotificationType` enum with values:
  - `TASK_ASSIGNMENT`: When admin assigns task to employee
  - `TASK_UPDATE`: When task details are updated
  - `STATUS_CHANGE`: When task status changes
  - `GENERAL`: For system announcements

## Implementation Components

### 1. Utility Functions (`src/lib/notifications.ts`)

- Created helper functions for notification operations:
  - `createNotification`: Base function to create notifications
  - `createTaskAssignmentNotification`: For new task assignments
  - `createTaskStatusChangeNotification`: For status changes
  - `createTaskUpdateNotification`: For task updates and notes
  - `getUserNotifications`: Retrieve user's notifications
  - `markNotificationAsRead`: Mark individual notification as read
  - `markAllNotificationsAsRead`: Mark all notifications as read

### 2. Server Actions (`src/app/dashboard/notifications/actions.ts`)

- Implemented server actions to handle notification operations:
  - `getMyNotifications`: Fetch current user's notifications
  - `markNotificationAsRead`: Mark notification as read
  - `markAllNotificationsAsRead`: Mark all notifications as read

### 3. UI Components

- `NotificationsWrapper`: Client component that fetches notifications data

  - Handles data fetching and re-fetching every 30 seconds
  - Maintains notification state with React hooks

- `NotificationDropdown`: UI component for notification display
  - Bell icon with unread count badge
  - Dropdown menu with notification list
  - Color-coded by notification type
  - Mark as read functionality
  - Click to navigate to relevant page

### 4. Integration with Task Actions

- Updated task-related server actions to create notifications:
  - Create task → Notify assigned employee
  - Update task → Notify assigned employee
  - Change task status → Notify admin/employee based on who made the change
  - Add task note → Notify relevant parties
  - Delete task → Notify assigned employee

## Technical Decisions

1. **Server-Side Storage**: Notifications are stored in the database for persistence
2. **Polling**: Client-side polling every 30 seconds instead of WebSockets for simplicity
3. **Role-Based Visibility**: Notifications are shown only to their intended recipients
4. **Mark as Read**: Single and bulk mark-as-read functionality
5. **Navigation**: Notifications link directly to relevant tasks/pages

## Testing Approach

- Created sample notifications in the seed file for testing
- Added test notifications for both admin and employee users
- Manual testing of notification creation and display
- Verified read/unread functionality

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time notifications using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events
- Email notifications for critical updates
- Notification preferences (email, in-app, etc.)
- Better grouping and categorization of notifications
- Mobile push notifications
