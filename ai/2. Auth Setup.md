## Stage 2: Auth and UI Logic

### Prompt

After our first step (DB setup), let's go through the second: working with auth.

As we agreed:

### 1. User:

- Fields: `id` (cuid), `name`, `email` (unique), `password`, `role` ("ADMIN" | "EMPLOYEE"), timestamps
- One-to-one optional relation with `Employee`

### 2. Employee:

- Fields: `id` (cuid), `employeeId` (6-digit unique string), `employmentDate`, `basicSalary` (int), `isActive` (boolean, default `true`), timestamps
- One-to-one required relation with `User`
- One-to-many relation to `Salary` and `Task`

---

Now rewrite me this AI prompt to deal with:

- Auth
- Sidebar
- And related UI/UX

Steps:

- Check the current register page
- Make the register page include required fields with form validation using `zod`
- When creating a user:
  - Add role selection
  - If role is "EMPLOYEE", create the `Employee` instance and link it with the created user
- Update the navbar:
  - Show `Login` / `Register` if user is logged out
  - Show `Dashboard` / `Home` if the user is logged in
- Ensure logout option works

### Sidebar:

- If `ADMIN`:
  - Show `Dashboard`, `Employees`, `Salaries`, `Projects` (to match assignment and DB design)
- If `EMPLOYEE`:
  - Show the same except `Employees` page

Focus on UI/UX quality and improvements.
