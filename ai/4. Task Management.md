# Task Management System Implementation

## Overview

The task management system in Blurr HR Portal provides a comprehensive solution for managing project tasks with a kanban-style board, task assignments, and status tracking. This document outlines the implementation approach and technical details of the task management features.

## Database Schema

- Key models related to task management:

  - `Project`: Contains project information
  - `Task`: Contains task details and relationships
  - `TaskAction`: Tracks history of task changes
  - `Employee`: For task assignments
  - `User`: For authentication and authorization

- Task model fields:

  - `id`: CUID primary key
  - `title`: Task title
  - `description`: Optional task description
  - `status`: Enum (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, DONE)
  - `dueDate`: Optional deadline
  - `assignedToId`: Reference to Employee
  - `projectId`: Reference to Project
  - `createdAt` & `updatedAt`: Timestamps

- TaskAction model fields (for historical tracking):
  - `id`: CUID primary key
  - `description`: Description of the action
  - `note`: Optional note
  - `oldStatus`: Previous status (if status changed)
  - `newStatus`: New status (if status changed)
  - `taskId`: Reference to Task
  - `userId`: Reference to User who performed the action
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp

## Implementation Components

### 1. Server Actions for Task Management

- Created server actions (`src/app/dashboard/projects/[projectId]/actions.ts`):
  - `createTask`: Add a new task to a project
  - `updateTask`: Update task details
  - `updateTaskStatus`: Change task status (with validation)
  - `addTaskNote`: Add notes to tasks
  - `deleteTask`: Remove a task
  - `getProjectTasks`: Get all tasks for a project, grouped by status
  - `getTaskDetails`: Get detailed information about a task
  - `getAvailableEmployees`: Get employees for assignment

### 2. Task Board Component

- Implemented Kanban board (`task-board.tsx`) using @hello-pangea/dnd:
  - Displays tasks grouped by status columns
  - Enables drag-and-drop functionality
  - Updates task status via server actions
  - Visual indicators for task priority and status
  - Card display with task details, assigned employee, and dates

### 3. Role-Based Access Control

- Admin capabilities:

  - Create, update, and delete tasks
  - Assign tasks to any employee
  - Move tasks between any status
  - Archive projects

- Employee capabilities:
  - View assigned tasks
  - Update task status (with step-by-step progression)
  - Add notes to assigned tasks
  - Cannot edit other employees' tasks

### 4. Task Status Progression Logic

- For employees, implemented step-by-step progression:

  - PENDING → IN_PROGRESS → DONE (only one step at a time)
  - Cannot skip statuses or move backward

- For admins:
  - Full control over task status
  - Can move tasks to any status

### 5. Task History Tracking

- All task changes are recorded in `TaskAction` model
- Task actions track:
  - Status changes
  - Notes added
  - Task creation/deletion
  - User who made the change
  - Timestamp

## Technical Decisions

1. **Drag and Drop**: Used @hello-pangea/dnd for smooth user experience
2. **Server Actions**: Next.js server actions for all data mutations
3. **Validation**: Zod-based schema validation for all inputs
4. **Role-Based Logic**: Different permissions based on user role
5. **History Tracking**: Complete audit trail of task changes

## Testing Approach

- Verified task creation and assignment
- Tested drag-and-drop functionality
- Confirmed role-based restrictions work correctly
- Validated task history tracking
- Checked notification integration

## Future Enhancements

- Add task priority levels and filtering
- Implement task deadlines with reminders
- Add file attachments to tasks
- Enable task commenting system
- Implement task templates for common workflows
- Add time tracking functionality
- Create task dependency relationships
