# Dashboard and Analytics

## Objective

Create comprehensive dashboards with real-time analytics tailored to different user roles (Admin vs Employee) to provide actionable insights and improve decision-making.

## Key Requirements

### Statistics by Role

#### Admin Dashboard

- **Salary Analytics**

  - Total payable salaries (monthly breakdown)
  - Overall salary expenditure trends
  - Paid vs unpaid salary counts
  - Average salary by department/team

- **Employee Metrics**

  - Total employee count
  - Active vs inactive employees
  - Employee distribution by department
  - Recent hires and terminations

- **Project Insights**

  - Active vs archived projects
  - Project completion rates
  - Resource allocation across projects
  - Projects nearing deadline

- **Task Analytics**
  - Task counts grouped by status (PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, DONE)
  - Overdue tasks count
  - Task completion rate
  - Average time to completion

#### Employee Dashboard

- **Personal Tasks**

  - My tasks by status
  - Upcoming deadlines
  - Task priority distribution
  - Recent activity timeline

- **Project Participation**

  - Projects I'm assigned to
  - My contribution metrics
  - Team progress indicators

- **Salary Information**
  - Current month salary breakdown
  - Historical salary data
  - Bonus/deduction history

### UI/UX Requirements

- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Interactive charts and graphs (line, bar, pie) using shadcn/ui chart components
- Card-based layout with consistent spacing and dimensions
- Color-coded status indicators
- Data filters (by date range, project, employee)
- Print/export functionality for reports

## Technical Implementation

### Data Fetching

```typescript
// Example dashboard data fetching with Prisma
export async function getDashboardStats(userId: string, role: string) {
  // Role-based queries
  if (role === "ADMIN") {
    const employees = await prisma.employee.count({
      where: { isActive: true },
    });

    const projects = await prisma.project.findMany({
      include: {
        _count: {
          select: { tasks: true },
        },
      },
    });

    const tasks = await prisma.task.groupBy({
      by: ["status"],
      _count: true,
    });

    // More admin-specific queries...

    return { employees, projects, tasks };
  } else {
    // Employee-specific dashboard data
    const myTasks = await prisma.task.findMany({
      where: {
        employee: { userId },
      },
      include: {
        project: true,
      },
    });

    // More employee-specific queries...

    return { myTasks };
  }
}
```

### Chart Components

```tsx
// Example reusable chart component
import { Bar } from "@/components/ui/chart";

export function TaskStatusChart({ data }: { data: TaskStatusData[] }) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Tasks by Status</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <Bar
          data={{
            labels: data.map((d) => d.status),
            datasets: [
              {
                label: "Tasks",
                data: data.map((d) => d.count),
                backgroundColor: ["rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.5)", "rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.5)", "rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.5)"],
              },
            ],
          }}
          options={{
            responsive: true,
            plugins: {
              legend: {
                position: "top" as const,
              },
            },
          }}
        />
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Real-time Updates

Consider using SWR or React Query for data fetching with automatic revalidation:

```tsx
import useSWR from 'swr';

function AdminDashboard() {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR(
    '/api/dashboard/admin-stats',
    fetcher,
    { refreshInterval: 30000 } // Refresh every 30 seconds
  );

  if (isLoading) return <DashboardSkeleton />;
  if (error) return <DashboardError />;

  return (
    // Dashboard UI with data
  );
}
```

## AI Chatbot Integration

- Add a floating button in the bottom right corner for accessing the AI assistant
- Implement a chat interface with pre-defined responses related to dashboard data
- Include example prompts like "Show me overdue tasks" or "What's my salary this month?"
- Design the interface to match the overall application style
- Document the placeholder nature with clear path for future AI integration

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for data calculation functions
- Component tests for chart and dashboard widgets
- Integration tests for data fetching and state management
- End-to-end tests for dashboard interaction flows

## Documentation

- Create detailed markdown files documenting dashboard metrics definitions and calculations
- Include screenshots of the implemented dashboard in documentation
- Document the component architecture and data flow
- Provide usage examples for dashboard interaction

## Future Enhancements

- PDF export of dashboard reports
- Email scheduling of regular reports
- Custom dashboard widget arrangement
- Advanced filtering and drill-down capabilities
- Integration with third-party analytics platforms
